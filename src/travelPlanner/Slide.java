	 * Serializability of a class is enabled by the class implementing the java.io.Serializable interface. 
	 * Classes that do not implement this interface will not have any of their state serialized or deserialized. 
	 * All subtypes of a serializable class are themselves serializable. 
	 * The serialization interface has no methods or fields and serves only to identify the semantics of being serializable.
	 * To allow subtypes of non-serializable classes to be serialized, the subtype may assume responsibility for saving and 
	 * restoring the state of the supertype's public, protected, and (if accessible) package fields. 
	 * The subtype may assume this responsibility only if the class it extends has an accessible no-arg constructor 
	 * to initialize the class's state. It is an error to declare a class Serializable if this is not the case. 
	 * The error will be detected at runtime.
